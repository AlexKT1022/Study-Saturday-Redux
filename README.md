# Study Saturdays: Week 3 - React-Redux

## **Objective:** Build an app to display students and their test scores
- [x] **Cycle 0:** Build the store
- [ ] **Cycle 1:** `connect` the React component  ⭐️
- [ ] **Cycle 2:** Set up React Router for a "single student" view
- [ ] **Cycle 3:** Make the single student route functional
- [ ] **Cycle 4 (Bonus):** Delete a student

## Steps

- [ ] The `StudentList` component is currently displaying dummy data. Use `connect` to hook it up to your Redux store, and fetch the right data.
