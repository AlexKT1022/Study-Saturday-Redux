# Study Saturdays: Week 3 - React-Redux

## **Objective:** Build a Redux store to display all students in our app
- [ ] **Cycle 0:** Create the store ⭐️
- [ ] **Cycle 1:** `connect` your React components to your Redux store
- [ ] **Cycle 2:** Display the dummy data
- [ ] **Cycle 3:** Write the thunk
- [ ] **Cycle 4 (Bonus):** Delete a student

## Steps

- [ ] Build out the Redux store
  - See the dummy data in `components/Main.js` for an example of how the data will be structured
- [ ] Test your Redux store functionality
  - Dispatch a few actions to your reducer, then check the logs in your console. Is it doing what you expect?
- [ ] Once done and tested, `git checkout cycle-1`
